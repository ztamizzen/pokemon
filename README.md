# Pokedex
Uses react and express

Express handles the calls to the
 PokeAPI through proxy (see index.js for how).

Started using Redux but it doesn't do much right now.

## TODO's
* Implement redux (started)
* ~~Separate components more~~
* Separate CSS more (halfway there)
* ~~Put things in separate folders~~ (sort of done)
* Pick a better color scheme
